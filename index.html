                Hi! Thank you for coming to look at my portfolio! I am really excited for you to see everything I have
                been working on recently. You will find that I have a love for animals, and I relate to them often. I
                also think it's okay to discuss serious things in a humorous light, since sometimes, all you can control
                is how loud you laugh. I hope you enjoy my work, which you can explore by clicking on the links below:
